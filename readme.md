# Simple bmptk example projects, grouped by target.

These examples just show how assembler, 
C and C++ projects can be set up with bmptk.
For more interesting examples, 
check hwlib and hwlib-examples.

The makefile in this directory can 
clean or build (all) applications.

The makefile.link is included by the makefiles in 
the subdirectories; it includes bmptk/makefile.inc.

The makefile in each example directory can
clean, build or run the example.
